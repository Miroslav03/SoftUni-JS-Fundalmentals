1. Write a password reset program that performs a series of commands upon a predefined string. First, you will receive a string, and afterward, until the command "Done" is given, you will be receiving strings with commands split by a single space. The commands will be the following:
•	"TakeOdd"
o	 Takes only the characters at odd indices and concatenates them to obtain the new raw password and then prints it.
•	"Cut {index} {length}"
o	Gets the substring with the given length starting from the given index from the password and removes its first occurrence, then prints the password on the console.
o	The given index and the length will always be valid.
•	"Substitute {substring} {substitute}"
o	If the raw password contains the given substring, replaces all of its occurrences with the substitute text given and prints the result.
o	If it doesn't, prints "Nothing to replace!".
Input
•	You will be receiving strings until the "Done" command is given.
Output
•	After the "Done" command is received, print:
o	"Your password is: {password}"
Constraints
•	The indexes from the "Cut {index} {length}" command will always be valid.
Examples

2. Your first task is to determine if the given sequence of characters is a valid barcode or not. 
Each line must not contain anything else but a valid barcode. A barcode is valid when:
•	It is surrounded by a "@" followed by one or more "#"
•	It is at least 6 characters long (without the surrounding "@" or "#")
•	It starts with a capital letter
•	It contains only letters (lower and upper case) and digits
•	It ends with a capital letter
Examples of valid barcodes: @###Che46sE@##, @#FreshFisH@#, @###Brea0D@###, @##Che46sE@##
Examples of invalid barcodes: ##InvaliDiteM##, @InvalidIteM@, @#Invalid_IteM@#
Next, you have to determine the product group of the item from the barcode. The product group is obtained by concatenating all the digits found in the barcode. If there are no digits present in the barcode, the default product group is "00".
Examples:  
@#FreshFisH@# -> product group: 00
@###Brea0D@### -> product group: 0
@##Che4s6E@## -> product group: 46
Input
On the first line, you will be given an integer n – the count of barcodes that you will be receiving next. 
On the following n lines, you will receive different strings.
Output
For each barcode that you process, you need to print a message.
If the barcode is invalid:
•	"Invalid barcode"
If the barcode is valid:
•	"Product group: {product group}"
 

3. On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer n – the number of heroes that you can choose for your party. On the next n lines, the heroes themselves will follow with their hit points and mana points separated by a single space in the following format:

"{hero name} {HP} {MP}"

- HP stands for hit points and MP for mana points

- a hero can have a maximum of 100 HP and 200 MP

After you have successfully picked your heroes, you can start playing the game. You will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by " – ", until the "End" command is given.

There are several actions that the heroes can perform:

"CastSpell – {hero name} – {MP needed} – {spell name}"

· If the hero has the required MP, he casts the spell, thus reducing his MP. Print this message:

o "{hero name} has successfully cast {spell name} and now has {mana points left} MP!"

· If the hero is unable to cast the spell print:

o "{hero name} does not have enough MP to cast {spell name}!"

"TakeDamage – {hero name} – {damage} – {attacker}"

· Reduce the hero HP by the given damage amount. If the hero is still alive (his HP is greater than 0) print:

o "{hero name} was hit for {damage} HP by {attacker} and now has {current HP} HP left!"

· If the hero has died, remove him from your party and print:

o "{hero name} has been killed by {attacker}!"

"Recharge – {hero name} – {amount}"

· The hero increases his MP. If it brings the MP of the hero above the maximum value (200), MP is increased to 200. (the MP can't go over the maximum value).

· Print the following message:

o "{hero name} recharged for {amount recovered} MP!"

"Heal – {hero name} – {amount}"

· The hero increases his HP. If a command is given that would bring the HP of the hero above the maximum value (100), HP is increased to 100 (the HP can't go over the maximum value).

· Print the following message:

o "{hero name} healed for {amount recovered} HP!"

Input

· On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer n

· On the following n lines, the heroes themselves will follow with their hit points and mana points separated by a space in the following format

· You will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by " – ", until the "End" command is given

Output

· Print all members of your party who are still alive, in the following format (their HP/MP need to be indented 2 spaces):

"{hero name}

HP: {current HP}

MP: {current MP}"

Constraints

· The starting HP/MP of the heroes will be valid, 32-bit integers will never be negative or exceed the respective limits.

· The HP/MP amounts in the commands will never be negative.

· The hero names in the commands will always be valid members of your party. No need to check that explicitly
