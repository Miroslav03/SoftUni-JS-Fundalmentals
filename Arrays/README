1.	Sum First and Last Array Elements
Write a function that receives an array of numbers and prints the sum of the first and last element in that array.

2.	Day of Week
Write a program, which receives a number and prints the corresponding name of the day of the week (in English).  
If the number is NOT a valid day, print: "Invalid day!".

3.	Reverse an Array of Numbers
Write a program, which receives a number n and an array of elements. Your task is to create a new array with n numbers from the original array, reverse it and print its elements on a single line, space-separated.

4.	Reverse In Place
Write a program, which receives an array of strings. Your task is to reverse the array without creating a new array. Print the resulting elements on a single line, space-separated. 

5.	Sum Even Numbers
Write a program, which receives an array of strings, parse them into numbers, and sum only the even numbers.

6.	Even and Odd Subtraction
Write a program that calculates the difference between the sum of the even and the sum of the odd numbers in an array.

7.	Equal Arrays
Write a program, which receives two string arrays containing number representations, and prints on the console whether they are identical.
Arrays are identical if their elements at same indexes are equal. If they are identical, find the sum of the first array and print the following message: 
`Arrays are identical. Sum: {sum}`
 If the arrays are NOT identical, find the first index where the arrays differ and print the following message:
 `Arrays are not identical. Found difference at {index} index`

8.	Condense Array to Number
Write a program, which receives an array of numbers, and condenses them by summing adjacent couples of elements until a single number is obtained. 
Examples
For example, if we have 3 elements [2, 10, 3], we sum the first two and the second two elements and obtain {2+10, 10+3} = {12, 13}, then we sum again all adjacent elements and obtain {12+13} = {25}.
